Among our drivers, there are drivers who use Fake GPS application to mock their location. This FGPS usage is unfair for other GOJEK drivers who work honestly. Hence, we would like to apply a machine learning model to classify whether a trip is being done using fake GPS or not based on their PING behavior.

Brief Description
You are provided with an anonymized dataset of drivers PING signals containing numeric feature variables, the binary target column, and a string order_id column.

The task is to predict the value of the label column in the test set.

Data fields
order_id - an anonymous id unique to a given order number
service_type - service type, can be GORIDE or GOFOOD
driver_status - status of the driver PING, can be AVAILABLE, UNAVAILABLE, OTW_PICKUP, OTW_DROPOFF
hour - hour
seconds - seconds in linux format
latitude - GPS latitude
longitude - GPS longitude
altitude_in_meters - GPS Altitude
accuracy_in_meters - GPS Accuracy, the smaller the more accurate

MY WORK:

I made models to predict class. 
The dataset consists of the order_id which is the unique key. Each order id consists of many data rows representing pings which will give 8 different informations (columns). So the 'usefull' informations (data) must be extracted from the pings on each order id. Data extracting dan preparation will located on df_train_cleaning.ipynb, and the cleaned datased saved on clean_df_train.csv. The ML's model performances will provide on MLs.ipynb.
