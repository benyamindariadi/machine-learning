Context
There are 4 groups of people and 217 hobby's and interest questions. Like do you like to play chess? Y/N.

All pre-processing was done before because that takes a tonne of time in python and this is testing of the idea for the computer to tell me something I dont know.

Content
6000 people with 4 groups and 217 questions on types of interests

Inspiration
In the final cluster. I;d like to know which groups of interests are for each groups of people.

Like groups "c" have 80% of Interest5 and Interest115

later I wanted to do some supervised learning and see if we can predict the groups from the interests.


ABOUT MY PROJECT:
I tried to make ML models to predict the groups based on the interests.
